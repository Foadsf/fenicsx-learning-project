## Installation and Setup on Windows (Step-by-Step)

FEniCSx does not run natively on Windows. The recommended and most robust method is to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2).

### Step 1: Install WSL2 and Ubuntu
First, enable WSL2 on your Windows machine and install a Linux distribution.

1.  **Open PowerShell as Administrator.**
2.  **Install WSL2 and Ubuntu:** This single command handles everything.
    ```powershell
    wsl --install
    ```
3.  **Restart your computer** when prompted. After restarting, Ubuntu will complete its installation. You will be asked to create a username and password for your new Linux environment.

### Step 2: Set Up the FEniCSx Environment inside WSL2
Now, open your new Ubuntu terminal (you can find it in the Start Menu). All the following commands are run inside this terminal.

1.  **Install Mamba:** Mamba is a much faster alternative to `conda` for managing packages.
    ```bash
    # Download the Mambaforge installer
    wget "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"

    # Run the installer script
    bash Mambaforge-*.sh -b -p "${HOME}/mambaforge"

    # Activate mamba and initialize your shell
    source "${HOME}/mambaforge/bin/activate"
    mamba init

    # Close and reopen your Ubuntu terminal for changes to take effect
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate the FEniCSx Environment:**
    ```bash
    # Create the environment with all necessary packages
    mamba create -n fenicsx-env -c conda-forge fenics-dolfinx mpich pyvista h5py matplotlib

    # Activate the new environment
    conda activate fenicsx-env
    ```
    Your terminal prompt should now start with `(fenicsx-env)`.

### Step 3: Clone this Repository
Clone this project to get all the examples and helper scripts.

```bash
# Navigate to your home directory and clone the project
cd ~
git clone https://Foadsf/FEniCSx-Learning-Project.git
cd FEniCSx-Learning-Project
```

### Step 4: Install ParaView on Windows
For high-quality 3D visualization, we will use ParaView on the Windows host.

1.  Download and install ParaView from the [official website](https://www.paraview.org/download/).
2.  The typical installation path is `C:\Program Files\ParaView X.Y.Z`.

You are now fully set up!

## Running the Poisson Example

This workflow demonstrates how to solve a PDE inside WSL2 and visualize the results using tools on both Linux and Windows.

**1. Run the Solver:**
   Navigate to the example directory and run the Python script.
   ```bash
   # Make sure you are in the (fenicsx-env) environment
   cd examples/01_poisson_basic/
   python3 poisson_demo.py
   ```
   This will solve the PDE and create `poisson_solution.xdmf` and `.h5` files in the `output` directory.

**2. (Optional) Export to More Formats:**
   The default XDMF format can sometimes be problematic for ParaView. The included helper script exports the solution to multiple, more robust formats like VTK.
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the helpers directory
   cd ../../helpers/
   python3 poisson_vtk_export.py
   ```

**3. Visualize with Python (Quick Check):**
   For a quick plot without leaving the terminal environment:
   ```bash
   # Still in the helpers directory
   python3 simple_visualization.py
   ```
   This will generate `poisson_visualization.png` in the `output` directory and may open an interactive Matplotlib window.

**4. Visualize with ParaView (High Quality):**
   The most powerful way to inspect the 3D solution is with ParaView. Run this command from your WSL2 terminal:
   ```bash
   # The path must point to your Windows ParaView installation
   "/mnt/c/Program Files/ParaView 5.13.1/bin/paraview.exe" ../output/poisson_simple.vtk
   ```
   This command launches the Windows ParaView application and automatically loads the solution file from your WSL2 filesystem.

## FEniCSx v0.9.0 API Notes

This project uses FEniCSx v0.9.0. A key lesson learned is that this version has a specific API for PETSc-based solvers.

-   **Always import the PETSc submodule:** `from dolfinx.fem import petsc as fem_petsc`
-   **Use `fem_petsc` for assembly:** `fem_petsc.assemble_matrix()` returns a `PETSc.Mat` object.
-   **Use `A.assemble()`:** PETSc matrices require a final assembly call after creation.
-   **Solver interface:** Pass the PETSc vector from the solution function: `solver.solve(b, uh.x.petsc_vec)`.

For a deep dive into the API discoveries and debugging process, see `docs/lessons_learned.md`.

## Troubleshooting

-   **`AttributeError: 'MatrixCSR' object has no attribute 'assemble'`**
    -   **Cause:** You are using the base `fem.assemble_matrix()` which returns a native C++ object.
    -   **Solution:** Use `fem_petsc.assemble_matrix()` which returns a PETSc-compatible matrix.
-   **ParaView crashes when opening `.xdmf` file**
    -   **Cause:** Compatibility issue between HDF5 library versions.
    -   **Solution:** Use the `poisson_vtk_export.py` helper to generate a simpler `.vtk` file, which is much more reliable.
-   **`ModuleNotFoundError`**
    -   **Solution:** Make sure your `fenicsx-env` conda environment is activated. Install any missing packages with `mamba install <package-name>`.

### PV QuickLook (ParaView)

A lightweight, cross-platform GUI to quickly preview simulation results without using the full ParaView UI.

**Script:** `helpers/pv_quicklook_gui.py`
**Supported inputs:** `.xdmf/.xmf`, `.pvd`, `.vtu/.pvtu`, `.vtk`, `.bp` (if available), and `.h5/.hdf5` via a companion `.xdmf`.

#### Quick start (Windows example)

```bash
python helpers\pv_quicklook_gui.py -v output\transient_heat_solution.xdmf
````

* In the GUI, set **ParaView GUI (optional)** to your ParaView desktop binary.
  Default path on Windows:
  `C:\Program Files\ParaView 5.13.1\bin\paraview.exe`
* The app will **infer `pvpython.exe`** from that path and render **off-process** using ParaView’s Python.
  (This avoids Python/ABI mismatches; your local Python can be 3.13+, while ParaView’s is 3.10.)
* Use the simple controls (representation, color by, time step, camera) and **Save Screenshot…**.
* **Open in ParaView GUI** launches the full ParaView if you want to deep-dive.

#### CLI options

* `-v, --verbose` – prints a diagnostic report (Python, PATH, sys.path, dataset, etc.) before the GUI starts.

#### Notes & troubleshooting

* If the preview fails, the **status bar** shows the exact error captured from `pvpython` (e.g., missing plugin, invalid XDMF, etc.).
* Rendering is done offscreen; no desktop OpenGL context is required.
* For `.h5` data, prefer providing an `.xdmf` sidecar describing topology/geometry.
